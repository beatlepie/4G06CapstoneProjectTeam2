\section{Usability Survey Result}\label{survey}

\section{Load Test}\label{load}

This section covers results load testing of the backend server in details.
Testing was performed using Apache JMeter to simulate multiple concurrent users accessing the backend chat server. The objective of the test was to find the upper bound of concurrent users that can access the server without it crashing.
We discovered that it is rather difficult to crash a server being hosted on a cloud platform as there are several safeguards that prevent that.
Instead, we noticed that if too many connections are being made too quickly, then the server will just reject the most recently requested connections.

\newpage

We tested with various amounts of simulated users and observed how the server behaved. The results are plotted in the chart below.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  No. of Users & Server Rejected Connections? & Server Crashed? \\ \hline
  1 & No & No \\ \hline
  10 & No & No \\ \hline
  100 & No & No \\ \hline
  500 & No & No \\ \hline
  1000 & No & No \\ \hline
  5000 & Yes & No \\ \hline
  10000 & Yes & No \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Load Testing Results}
\end{table}

We also observed analytics data from Microsoft Azure concerning the average response time of the server in relation to the number of requests.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{chart1.png}
  \caption{Requests vs. Response Time}
\end{figure}

There does not appear to be an observable trend. We believe this is because the test was limited by the amount of connections that could be made from one device.
Given a sufficient testing setup it should be possible to show a trend bewteen the amount of requests and the response time.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
