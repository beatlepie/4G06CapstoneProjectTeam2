This document describes the test results of the verification and validation (VnV) plan for CampusConnections. The VnV plan was continuously updated as the project evolved. The following document records the results of the current version of the VnV plan. It provides results of functional and non-functional requirements tests, unit tests, changes that will be implemented in the system as a result of the tests, and various traceability tables.

\section{Nonfunctional Requirements Evaluation}
The following section outlines the results of non-functional requirements testing. The process and test performed follow the \href{https://github.com/beatlepie/4G06CapstoneProjectTeam2/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{VnV Plan}. Most of the tests are tested manually while some of them are tested in another way, for instance, load testing is tested with JMeter while some UI requirements are tested by conducting a survey, etc. \textcolor{red}{Some of the tests fail because their related requirements are removed due to the change of the project's scope, these tests will be marked in red.} In general, most of the tests in the plan succeed, indicating that non-functional requirements in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document are covered.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
