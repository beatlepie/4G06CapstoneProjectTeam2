\section{Usability Survey Result}\label{survey}
We first conduct the survey on 5 students, and it seems that we are getting repetitive feedback, so we assume this is already a good sample size. The result of the survey is the following:
\subsection{Tasks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Administrator: 1 tester - all tasks are completed successfully 
\item User: 3 testers - all tasks are completed successfully
\item Guest: 1 tester - all tasks are completed successfully
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Rating}
\begin{itemize}
\item Immediate Visual Response when Clicking: \textbf{3.8}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Q1.png}
\item Appealing Colour Scheme: \textbf{4.8}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Q2.png}
\item No Technical or Software-specific Language: \textbf{4}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Q3.png}
\item Common periods of usage: \textbf{3.2, \textcolor{red}{Fail}}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Q4.png}
\item Cultural Friendliness: \textbf{4.8}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Q5.png}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Open-ended Question}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most difficult to use feature: \textbf{AR camera, pin, chatting}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The most difficult to use feature is probably the AR camera feature as it requires the user to use look through their phone camera while in buildings on campus. Additionally, it is also probably the most cool aspect of the app.
\item The lecture list isn't intuitive, there should be some calendar feature to show what days each lecture is running instead of just clicking on them, and maybe some more filters for building/location/course content.
\item The "pin" feature being hidden in the settings and the "AR Camera" not providing any feedback as to why we weren't seeing any were both confusing
\item The pinned/bookmarked events and lectures show up in a location (in settings) that is somewhat difficult to find. You also can't tap them to see more information about them on the pinned screen which is inconvenient.
\item Friend and chatting is unintuitive, don't know who I'm chatting with.
\end{enumerate}
\item Most likely to use feature: \textbf{Lecture/Event, AR camera}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Probably also the feature for looking up lecture events and times. This is useful as I can just open the app and view where specific lectures are located and choose to attend them or not.
\item I would use the AR camera feature to see interesting building history in between classes.
\item The feature that provided a schedule of all of the events was very nice
\item I could see the list of events at different locations being pretty useful, would be a good way to keep track of what's going on at Mac all in one place.
\item Events can be useful to see what is going on on campus and save events we want to go to
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Load Test}\label{load}

This section covers results load testing of the backend server in details.
Testing was performed using Apache JMeter to simulate multiple concurrent users accessing the backend chat server. The objective of the test was to find the upper bound of concurrent users that can access the server without it crashing.
We discovered that it is rather difficult to crash a server being hosted on a cloud platform as there are several safeguards that prevent that.
Instead, we noticed that if too many connections are being made too quickly, then the server will just reject the most recently requested connections.

\newpage

We tested with various amounts of simulated users and observed how the server behaved. The results are plotted in the chart below.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  No. of Users & Server Rejected Connections? & Server Crashed? \\ \hline
  1 & No & No \\ \hline
  10 & No & No \\ \hline
  100 & No & No \\ \hline
  500 & No & No \\ \hline
  1000 & No & No \\ \hline
  5000 & Yes & No \\ \hline
  10000 & Yes & No \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Load Testing Results}
\end{table}

We also observed analytics data from Microsoft Azure concerning the average response time of the server in relation to the number of requests.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{chart1.png}
  \caption{Requests vs. Response Time}
\end{figure}

There does not appear to be an observable trend. We believe this is because the test was limited by the amount of connections that could be made from one device.
Given a sufficient testing setup it should be possible to show a trend bewteen the amount of requests and the response time.

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}

\section{Unit Testing}
The following section outlines the results of unit testing. The process and test performed follow the \href{https://github.com/beatlepie/4G06CapstoneProjectTeam2/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{VnV Plan}. \textcolor{red}{Due to the time constraint, we skipped the unit tests for Database and Authentication modules, but we will add unit tests for them in Revision 1.} Other than the two modules, all the tests pass, which indicates the low level modules of the system is implemented correctly and robustly.\\

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
should be highlighted.}

\section{Automated Testing}
The tests are run from local machine as there were difficulties in implementing GitHub Action for it.
When attempting to setup the automated tests, there were issues due to how Vuforia was not a package that could be imported automatically.
This caused problems as the program failed to build automatically. The package was too big to be included in the repository, and Large File Storage had limits.
Due to the above reason, automated tests could not be performed through GitHub Actions, they could be run on local.
Parts of the below documentation is based on what was planned, and what is planned for phase 2 of the development.

\subsection{Testing Instruments}

The tests were performed using NUnit made for Unity.
The test files are located in multiple files with the respective names of the modules they are testing under Assets/Editor.
OpenCover was planned for coverage testing and will produce a report into xml file.
These results are visible after the automated tests are completed.

\subsection{GUI Testing}

Due to how this application targets multiple screen sizes and android versions, this was pushed to phase 2 of the development.
This test would require test cases for common models and continuous maintenance.
Additionally, the GUI is automatically scaled by the Unity to match screen sizes and most standard models will display as intended.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
