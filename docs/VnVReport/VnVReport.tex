\section{Usability Survey Result}\label{survey}
We first conduct the survey on 5 students, and it seems that we are getting repetitive feedback, so we assume this is already a good sample size. The result of the survey is the following:
\subsection{Tasks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Administrator: 1 tester - all tasks are completed successfully 
\item User: 3 testers - all tasks are completed successfully
\item Guest: 1 tester - all tasks are completed successfully
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Rating}
\begin{itemize}
\item Immediate Visual Response when Clicking: \textbf{3.8}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Q1.png}
\item Appealing Colour Scheme: \textbf{4.8}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Q2.png}
\item No Technical or Software-specific Language: \textbf{4}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Q3.png}
\item Common periods of usage: \textbf{3.2, \textcolor{red}{Fail}}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Q4.png}
\item Cultural Friendliness: \textbf{4.8}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Q5.png}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Open-ended Question}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most difficult to use feature: \textbf{AR camera, pin, chatting}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The most difficult to use feature is probably the AR camera feature as it requires the user to use look through their phone camera while in buildings on campus. Additionally, it is also probably the most cool aspect of the app.
\item The lecture list isn't intuitive, there should be some calendar feature to show what days each lecture is running instead of just clicking on them, and maybe some more filters for building/location/course content.
\item The "pin" feature being hidden in the settings and the "AR Camera" not providing any feedback as to why we weren't seeing any were both confusing
\item The pinned/bookmarked events and lectures show up in a location (in settings) that is somewhat difficult to find. You also can't tap them to see more information about them on the pinned screen which is inconvenient.
\item Friend and chatting is unintuitive, don't know who I'm chatting with.
\end{enumerate}
\item Most likely to use feature: \textbf{Lecture/Event, AR camera}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Probably also the feature for looking up lecture events and times. This is useful as I can just open the app and view where specific lectures are located and choose to attend them or not.
\item I would use the AR camera feature to see interesting building history in between classes.
\item The feature that provided a schedule of all of the events was very nice
\item I could see the list of events at different locations being pretty useful, would be a good way to keep track of what's going on at Mac all in one place.
\item Events can be useful to see what is going on on campus and save events we want to go to
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Load Test}\label{load}

This section covers results load testing of the backend server in details.
Testing was performed using Apache JMeter to simulate multiple concurrent users accessing the backend chat server. The objective of the test was to find the upper bound of concurrent users that can access the server without it crashing.
We discovered that it is rather difficult to crash a server being hosted on a cloud platform as there are several safeguards that prevent that.
Instead, we noticed that if too many connections are being made too quickly, then the server will just reject the most recently requested connections.

\newpage

We tested with various amounts of simulated users and observed how the server behaved. The results are plotted in the chart below.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  No. of Users & Server Rejected Connections? & Server Crashed? \\ \hline
  1 & No & No \\ \hline
  10 & No & No \\ \hline
  100 & No & No \\ \hline
  500 & No & No \\ \hline
  1000 & No & No \\ \hline
  5000 & Yes & No \\ \hline
  10000 & Yes & No \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Load Testing Results}
\end{table}

We also observed analytics data from Microsoft Azure concerning the average response time of the server in relation to the number of requests.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{chart1.png}
  \caption{Requests vs. Response Time}
\end{figure}

There does not appear to be an observable trend. We believe this is because the test was limited by the amount of connections that could be made from one device.
Given a sufficient testing setup it should be possible to show a trend bewteen the amount of requests and the response time.

\section{Non dynamic Tests Result}\label{static}
The weekly meetings mentioned in the VnV Plan, such as the weekly code review and TA feedback sessions, will not be detailed in this section due to their frequency and the fact that many of the conclusions drawn in these meetings have already been integrated and addressed in other sections, particularly non-requirements. However, their meeting minutes are accessible on our GitHub repository for those interested in further details.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}
\subsection{Changes due to Rev 0 demo feedback}
In Revision 0 of the demonstration, our instructor, Dr. Smith, pointed out that certain features, such as access control and the event list page, had not yet been implemented. These aspects were accorded higher priority in the development plan and have been successfully completed.

\subsection{Changes due to supervisor's feedback}
During the weekly meeting, our supervisor, Dr. Yuan, emphasized the necessity of reducing the sample size for the usability survey at this stage, which had previously been set at 50. Additionally, Dr. Yuan suggested incorporating tasks into the survey to facilitate thorough testing of the application by users. Consequently, the team collectively decided to integrate tasks and open-ended questions into the usability survey. This adjustment aims to gather more insightful feedback, discerning which aspects users like most and pinpointing features requiring improvement from a usability perspective.
\subsection{Changes due to usability test result}
The only test fails is the ``Common periods of usage'' rating question. It has come to light that survey participants express a preference for utilizing the application after school so that they won't miss any events happen in the evening. This observation is directly linked to maintenance requirement MS-M1. The team will change that major update time in that requirement to be summer break or weekend midnight to affect fewer users.\\
The absence of instructions for the AR camera has been repeatedly highlighted in the feedback. Consequently, the team will resolve this issue by adding instructions when user clicks on the help button. \\
Participants have noted that bookmarked lectures and events are not readily accessible, as they are currently hidden within the settings. In response to this feedback, the team will create a link to the bookmarked lectures and events page directly from the list pages. \\
Each of the aforementioned changes will be documented as a separate issue in the GitHub repo for future discussion.\\
\subsection{Changes due to load test result}
The load test in section \ref{load} shows that NFRT-P16 passes without any issues -- with fewer than 1000 users connecting to the application, the server handles the load effectively, as indicated by the nearly negligible response time observed in the figure. However, it is crucial to note that upon scaling up to accommodate approximately 40,000 concurrent requests after Revision 1, the server begins to reject connections and getting a significant increase in response time.Therefore, this is a good warning for the team regarding the need to scale the server infrastructure adequately to support a larger user base.
\subsection{Changes due to failing tests}
NFRT-P10 fails due to a change of the scope. The team will update SRS and VnV Plan so that internet connection lost warning is no longer a requirement.
\subsection{Changes due to user enumeration vulnerability}

User enumeration occurs when a malicious actor utilizes brute-force techniques to guess or confirm valid users within the system. In our application, this vulnerability can occur during the login process, where attackers can determine the validity of an email by analyzing error messages. 
Therefore, the team proposes implementing a more generic error message during login attempts (FRT-UA4). Additionally, a new test should be added to verify unsuccessful login attempts using an email not registered in the system.

On the other hand, the password recovery page effectively prevents this type of attack by only checking for email format without revealing whether the email exists in the system. 

Moreover, there are concerns regarding attackers exploiting server response times to detect user existence but that does not seem to be a problem with our application as Firebase's real-time database responds to valid and invalid login attempts with indistinguishable time differences.

Considering the project's scope and potential visibility (most of our customers will be students and department staff), enumeration attacks can be identified quickly. 
With majority of users having McMaster email and non-McMaster emails having guest privilages, this mitigates possible user enumeration attacks significantly.
In addition, the email verification process will allow Campus Connections team to easily identify suspicious activity.
With the aforementioned measures, the application sufficiently safeguards against such attacks.

\section{Automated Testing}
The majority of tests are run from local machine due to Unity and unity package size and behavior.
When attempting to setup the automated tests, there were issues due to how Vuforia was not a package that could be imported automatically due to how they host their library.
Communication with the database occurs asynchonously, which cause problems when testing automatically using CI/CD. 
This caused problems as the program failed to build automatically. The package was too big to be included in the repository, and Large File Storage had limits.
This also resulted in many tests being done locally.

\subsection{Testing Instruments}

The tests were performed using Unity Testing Framework, NUnit made for Unity.
The test files are located in multiple files with the respective names of the modules they are testing under Assets/Editor.
OpenCover was planned for coverage testing and will produce a report into XML file.
These results are visible after the automated tests are completed.
The CI with GitHub Actions will be completed in phase 2.

\subsection{Linters}

Linters were added into CI using Super-linter. This is an open source linter maintained and used by many people, which shows its reliability.
The linter only checks the new contents in the repository, making it efficient and concise. 
The code linter has been active and we have fixed issues brought up by the test results such as duplicate code and formatting issues.
The results of linters are visible under the GitHub Actions tab.

\subsection{Reflection}
The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}

The execution of our testing plan was very different from how we initially envisioned in our VnV Plan. The VnV plan was written before any implementation had been done.
This resulted in us making several assumptions about how the final product would work. Of course, as our project evolved, many of our assumptions would need to be changed.\\

One of the main ways our actual VnV testing effort varied was the scope of what was tested. Due to time constraints, some of our planned features needed to be cut.
This resulted in some proposed test cases no longer being applicable. While it is natural for requirements and scope to change throughout a project's life, the invalidation of these tests
could potentially have been mitigated by creating the VnV Plan when the structure of the project is more concrete. In future VnV planning, we would either do our VnV planning after completing some of the
implementation, or by iterating on the previous VnV by making amendments and revisions.\\

Another thing that impacted our VnV testing effort was our level of familiarity with the testing tools available and how they interacted with our technology stack.
For example, we initially wanted to test our database-facing front-end code using the Unity Test Framework (UTF). Due to our lack of experience with UTF and Firebase, we assumed that
it would be possible to test Firebase code using UTF. This ended up not being the case and the tests that were planned were scrapped or pushed to our feature waiting list. In future VnV planning, we would
put more effort into learning the tools and technology needed to test our project before coming up with test plans.\\

Comparing how our testing efforts went with how we planned them taught us that it is best to be conservative with the scope of features as some development time must
be allocated to testing those features. We also learned to value iterative improvement by keeping the documentation ``alive'' with revisions along with the project.
Lastly, we gained experience with a wide variety of testing tools and techniques that will be valuable in future VnV planning and execution.
