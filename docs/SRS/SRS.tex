\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
\quad The project being outlined in this document is an social media application with location-specific features for \
McMaster University to allow the university's students to connect with each other. The project will allow for interaction \
between users, in addition to allowing users to find information on different parts of the main campus of McMaster \
University, including on-campus events and room availability in buildings.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.2.1] \textbf{Accurate Data Collection}
  The product must collect location and directional data to accurately ascertain the position of the user in the building \
  and campus. This will allow the user to interact with the system and other users of the product to enhance social \
  interactions. The error of data must be less than 5\%.

  \item[1.2.2] \textbf{Ease of Use}
  The product must be user friendly and convenient to use, as many university applications are not used or underused due to \
  the complexity and difficult operation. The end user must be able to easily download and learn the application without \
  external guidance. At least 90\% of users should feel comfortable about the product when conducting the user survey.

  \item[1.2.3] \textbf{Availability}
  The product must be able to support its users unless there is a planned maintenance or external failures. This is important \
  as the product is using real-time data and significant delays or down-times will impact the accuracy and usability of the \
  product.

  \item[1.2.4] \textbf{Reliable Data Communication}
  The product must have good and secure data communication to support the real-time nature of the product. This is important \
  as the product is using real-time data and significant delays will impact the accuracy and usability of the product. The \
  product must be able to provide the desired output within 5 seconds with good university WiFi connection.

  \item[1.2.5] \textbf{Protection of Personal Information}
  The product must keep all personal data provided by users secure in the database. Personal data will be collected securely \
  and only used for product functions. The application must support the removal of user data upon request. This is important \
  because users will complete a consent form that acknowledges their privacy.

  \item[1.2.6] \textbf{User Communication}
  The product must be able to support user-to-user communication. It should provide a friend system for users to add new \
  friends, send messages and emojis to friends and share current location and status (in lecture/event or free) with their \
  friends. This is important because the main purpose of the project is to allow users to connect with peers effectively.

  \item[1.2.7] \textbf{Interactable Campus Buildings}
  The product must be able to provide interactions between users and campus buildings. It must show the availability of the \
  lecture halls and information about ongoing events in a building since one of the purposes of the project is to help users \
  utilize campus resources effectively.

  \item[1.2.8] \textbf{Immersive User Experience}
  The product should provide an immersive user experience to the users with some XR technologies. At least 90\% of the users \
  should find the product much more attractive and immersive than other university applications when conducting the user \
  survey. An immersive user experience is one of the unique selling points of our product.

\end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}

The client for this project is the university administration and the related departments who will be approving our project as well as the users.

\subsection{Customer}

The primary customers are the students and department staff members who will be directly using the mobile application to connect with others and discover events.
Visitors to McMaster who are not students will also be able to use the application, however they will not be able to connect with other users.

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}

\begin{itemize}
\item Legal Experts – Consultants for legal advice regarding privacy laws
\item Subject Matter Experts – Experts in the field of AR development to be consulted for guidance
\item Usability Testers – UI/UX designers / testers that will recommend design ideas
\item IT Support Staff - Personnel that will maintain the app and fix any bugs that may appear.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{User Category: Students}
\begin{itemize}
\item User Role: Regular users of the app, including students from various faculties.

\item Subject Matter Experience: Varied levels of experience with the app's features

\item Technological Experience: Varied levels of experience with mobile technology depending on technical background

\item Other User Characteristics: Diverse age groups, ethnicities, interests, and majors
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas}
N/A
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}

\begin{itemize}
\item Key Users (Maximum priority): Students, club representatives and department members who are the most directly involved with the app and are critical to the continued success of the product.

\item Secondary Users: Campus visitors and occasional users such as high school students on a university tour learning about the campus.

\item Unimportant Users: Users with no association with McMaster university and no authorization looking to misuse the product
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Participation}

\quad Students, club representatives and contributing department members are expected to actively participate in providing feedback, usability testing, and suggesting new features during the development phase. Specifically:


Students can be expected to focus more on the immersion, navigation and the interaction improvements within the app by spending about 2-4 hours a week on the application and providing feedback.


Club/department representatives can be expected to focus more on feedback regarding event related features by spending about 1-3 hours a week on the application and providing feedback.


This method will ensure maximum efficiency in collecting useful feedback from the relevant user groups.

\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}

The finalized version of the product will be regularly serviced and maintained by trained IT support staff and administrators on campus to ensure performance requirements such as reliability, robustness etc. are consistently met. This role will be assumed by the developers in the release build.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
Currently, students do not have effective ways to connect with peers of same interest and resources available on campus.  One of the most accessible tools for students to utilize campus resources is OSCARplus. However the website only allow user to see the event calendar and register, -- it doesn't support interactions between users or advacned interactions between events and users -- users cannot get a list of registered events or ask organizers more details of the event.\\
As for lecture room information,  McMaster allows student to get a calendar of the course they enrolled, but not any other courses they are interested in. New students always get lost because of the poor description of lecture rooms.  Students are expecting an advanced lecture management system and a more detailed campus map in their daily life.

This application will not take place of any existing official tools. It intends to improve certain social networking processes students are following and provide a platform for users to connect with each other better. The following are some changes that will impact users.\\
\noindent\\
\textbf{Expand Networking}\\
Students will be able to expand networking when attending events lectures on this social media platform. Users may lose connection with peers when there is a failure in the system. 
\noindent\\
\textbf{Event Registration}\\
Students and alumni will be able to login with their McMaster email and customize a list of activities and even post their program and level, which means there will be a risk of personal identification information (PII) leakage if the data is not stored securely.
\noindent\\
\textbf{Lectures and Events Management}\\
This application can be utilized to get information about lecture and lecture time and location which should not be displayed publicly. Therefore insecure data storage may lead to data breaches.

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

The application will be completely stand alone and will not be interfacing with any existing systems.  As described in the previous section, this application should not affect or replace any existing systems.

\subsection{Potential User Problems}

Any potential adverse reactions related to using the device in which application is being launched on (mobile device or tablet) would extend to the use of this application.  Any adverse reactions of Virtual Reality and Augment Reality, like nausea, dizziness and disorientation would be introduced to the use of the application as well.

\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}

\begin{itemize}
\item The database free plan is not able to cope with our projected user growth pattern.
\item Low quality internet connection will lead to latency between user inputs and in-app reactions or even failures of loading some assets.
\item The accuracy of input data totally depends on device sensor (e.g. GPS). Low accuracy data may cause bad user experience.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}

Any failures or downtime on the server or the database may affect the availability of this application. In-app schedules may get out of date when the two external systems cannot provide new data or the administrator cannot update the schedule on time. There will also be a risk of violating privacy laws in the future since the application is collection personal information and there may be new laws prohibit this kind of information collection.

\section{Tasks}
\subsection{Project Planning}

The project schedule will follow the deadline for the deliverables outlined in the SFWRENG
4G06 course outline.

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}

\qquad There are no requirements to migrate to this product besides recruiting sufficient number of users.
With the the starting users, there may not be enough engagement for this application to be widely used.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}

\qquad Currently, all data we need are in OSCARplus and club management part of the university administration.
These data will be requested via API or a new web based or internal input system will be made to move all the data over to our product.

As this product handles real time data, there is no need to migrate outdated data to the product.

\section{Costs}

In the initial release build of our application, we will be keeping costs at an absolute minimum. We will be utilizing free technologies such as Vuforia for image recognition features and MongoDB as our database solution, our development expenses will remain at \$0. Additionally, we plan on using GitHub's free hosting service for the deployment of our application, further eliminating any hosting-related expenses. We plan to scale our infrastructure with time where we may explore more premium options, such as AWS S3 bucket and MongoDB Atlas, to ensure the continued seamless operation and performance of our application while serving all McMaster students.

\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}

\begin{itemize}

\item Digital User Manual:

The purpose of the document will be to outline the main functions the product serves such as navigation and event discovery and how the user can make use of them. This will also highlight some common possible errors / mistakes that can occur and how the user should interact with the system to avoid them in the first place or handle them in a sensible manner if they occur.

 

\item Event Posting Guideline:

The purpose of this document will be to streamline and outline the process for clubs and departments to post events in the proper manner

\item Privacy Policy:

This document will display the data handling and user privacy rights clearly.

 

\item Terms of Service:

This document will outline terms of service and all user responsibilities.

\end{itemize}
Motivation:

User documentation will be created by the developers and will improve the on-app experience of the users.


\subsection{Training Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Admin training: 

Training provided to authorized club and department representatives on additional features associated with admin accounts such event posting / management and handling user issues.
\end{itemize}
Motivation: 

To provide a better experience for administrators and avoid overwhelming them with the additional features presented to them. The training plan and the physical training will be carried out by different developers.

\section{Waiting Room}
\begin{itemize}
  \item User generated content such as text or image posts.
  \item ``Gamification'' features (i.e. collectibles, achievements, stickers, \dots) to increase or incentivize social engagement.
\end{itemize}
\section{Ideas for Solution}
Implementation ideas for solutions
\begin{itemize}
\item AR feature
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Vuforia supports some AR functionalities and works as a library of Unity
	\item gather.town might be a good design approach to follow after from the campus navigation and interaction perspective
	\end{itemize}
\item Server
	\begin{itemize}
	\item AWS might be a purchasable and reliable option for the back-end
	\item SignalR is a real-time communication library used by lots of other projects, it is based on C\#, so it should work with ASP.NET as our back-end server
	\end{itemize}
\item Map
\begin{itemize}
	\item The library Mapbox can be useful for outdoor positioning and it is compatible with Unity.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  
  
\quad The team members will need to collectively acquire some technical and non-technical skills and knowledge in order to succeed in this capstone project. The following is a list of skills that are critical to the project and course deliverables.
  \begin{enumerate}[1]
      \item Presentation skills for demonstrations and capstone EXPO
      \item Documentation skills
      \item Team management skills including time management and work distribution
      \item Skills of Unity game development
      \item Skills of Unity AR development
      \item Integrating external backend systems into a Unity project
      \item Skills of git
      \item Front-end development skills
      \item Back-end development skills including server deployment and database
      \item Organizational skills to lead meetings and discussions on unclear topics in the project
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
  
  
\quad For non-technical skills, team members can develop those skills by practicing and attending courses/workshops. Members can leverage LinkedIn Learning and McMaster workshops to develop management and organizational skills. For documentation and presentation skills, team members can also join related events hosted by the university or refer to past documents and presentations.\\
  There are even more resources available for developing technical skills. Online learning platforms like Udemy will be used for the team to learn new technology-specific domain knowledge and skills. Other online resources like YouTube tutorials and official documentation can help the team master those technical skills as well.\\
  Listed below under each team member's name is a list of skills that the team member will focus on and why they decide to work on them.\\
\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Zihao Du}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Skills: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
      \end{itemize}
      Soft skills are quite important for a team and an engineer. And that's why I'd like to focus on soft skills like presentation skills and documentation skills. It will be not only critical to succeed in this capstone project but also beneficial to software engineering careers. Communication plays a very important role in software engineer's daily work and I will take this opportunity to further improve my skills.\\
      I'll also focus on Unity game development and front-end development because that attracts me the most and what I have the most experience in and I'd like to strengthen my skills and learn more about game development during this project.
    \item \textbf{Michael (Minsung) Kim}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Skills: 3, 7, 9, 10
        \end{itemize}
        All documentation and work progress will be tracked on git and meetings. Additionally, the work done will always be added to git to keep track of all work records. This will improve my skills in git and allow me to resolve merge conflicts better and manage any issues from the CI/CD pipeline. As the liaison, I need to ensure that the team is on the right track and no misunderstandings are left. We will have meetings regarding work done to keep everyone updated and let everyone know which tasks may be difficult or require further clarification. There will be discussions before the supervisor meeting so that we know what we need to ask and what subjects we could use their advice in. \\
        I will focus on the back-end of the project so that data communication is secure and efficient. I am very interested in the database architecture and encryption that goes into on disk and in transit communication. I will learn more about different databases such as SQL and MongoDB, their benefits and security. As I have the advanced databases course, this will help me with the database skills. The information security course will help with the data encryption part of the back-end development as well. Further research and looking into open source libraries that support back-end will help significantly as well.
      \item \textbf{Firas Elayan}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Skills: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
        \end{itemize}
        Unity and other general platforms for developing products such as the one in our capstone project are a new field to me that I do not have a lot of experience in. I'd like to acquire a near-advanced level of technical skills in relation to those platforms so that I'm able to build an array of good products of a very useful type that function properly and meet all requirements.\\
        Git is an extremely beneficial tool if used correctly. I'd like to improve my skills in git to ensure this project and future projects I participate in building have a smooth development life, especially with how expensive errors and issues can become the more complex the project gets.
      \item \textbf{Matthew Miller}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Skills: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
        \end{itemize}
        I want to work on my presentation skills and documentation skills so that I can focus on improving my oral and written communication skills. Since I have autism, communication has always been a challenge, so I would like to take the opportunity to work on those skills.
        I also chose to focus on Unity game development skills, front-end development skills, and back-end development skills so that I can gain experience with a variety of different coding skills.

      \item \textbf{Waseef Nayeem}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Skills: 2, 4, 5, 6, 10
        \end{itemize}
        I have chosen to focus on a combination of skills that I am experienced in as well ones that are more difficult or new to me. Game development is one of my passions and main hobbies and I always want to learn new techniques to improve my skills. This is why I want to focus on the Unity game and AR development tasks. Since most of my experience is with 2D games, 3D will pose some challenges that I am excited to tackle. I am also interested in learning how to integrate external systems and services into game engines such as Unity as I believe the experience will benefit my future projects. My work on prior projects has taught me the importance of proper documentation. I could improve my documentations skills by practicing technical writing or documentation prior projects. I could also learn new documentation tools and techniques such as using GitHub's wiki features or making a ReadTheDocs page. Lastly, I would like to improve my organization and participation in team settings. To accomplish this I could prepare a personal agenda of items ahead of time or log a to-do list of action items.
        
      \item \textbf{Abhiram Neelamraju}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Skills: 3, 4, 5, 6
        \end{itemize}
        The skills I plan on acquiring and focusing on have been chosen based on where I feel like I want to improve the most and where I feel like I can contribute the most. I want to be a good team member and possess good team management skills so that I can do well in the future as well in team oriented- environments. I can do so by taking an active role in group discussions and doing my fair share of work on time. I’m also extremely interested in learning about the Unity engine as a whole (4,5,6). Starting from learning basic skills related to Unity game development and Unity AR development. These skills can be acquired through looking through the detailed and comprehensive documentation available online and well as free video tutorials on websites such as YouTube. The specific skills for Integrating external backend systems into a Unity project is more specific and will be learned more through reading documentation, but there are still video tutorials that teach these skills which I will be following. I also plan on exploring paid options for digital courses on websites such as coursera and Udemy.

\end{itemize}
