\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
\quad The project being outlined in this document is an social media application with location-specific features for \
McMaster University to allow the university's students to connect with each other. The project will allow for interaction \
between users, in addition to allowing users to find information on different parts of the main campus of McMaster \
University, including on-campus events and room availability in buildings.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.2.1] \textbf{Accurate Data Collection}
  The product must collect location and directional data to accurately ascertain the position of the user in the building \
  and campus. This will allow the user to interact with the system and other users of the product to enhance social \
  interactions. The error of data must be less than 5%.

  \item[1.2.2] \textbf{Ease of Use}
  The product must be user friendly and convenient to use, as many university applications are not used or underused due to \
  the complexity and difficult operation. The end user must be able to easily download and learn the application without \
  external guidance. At least 90% of users should feel comfortable about the product when conducting the user survey.

  \item[1.2.3] \textbf{Availability}
  The product must be able to support its users unless there is a planned maintenance or external failures. This is important \
  as the product is using real-time data and significant delays or down-times will impact the accuracy and usability of the \
  product.

  \item[1.2.4] \textbf{Reliable Data Communication}
  The product must have good and secure data communication to support the real-time nature of the product. This is important \
  as the product is using real-time data and significant delays will impact the accuracy and usability of the product. The \
  product must be able to provide the desired output within 5 seconds with good university WiFi connection.

  \item[1.2.5] \textbf{Protection of Personal Information}
  The product must keep all personal data provided by users secure in the database. Personal data will be collected securely \
  and only used for product functions. The application must support the removal of user data upon request. This is important \
  because users will complete a consent form that acknowledges their privacy.

  \item[1.2.6] \textbf{User Communication}
  The product must be able to support user-to-user communication. It should provide a friend system for users to add new \
  friends, send messages and emojis to friends and share current location and status (in lecture/event or free) with their \
  friends. This is important because the main purpose of the project is to allow users to connect with peers effectively.

  \item[1.2.7] \textbf{Interactable Campus Buildings}
  The product must be able to provide interactions between users and campus buildings. It must show the availability of the \
  lecture halls and information about ongoing events in a building since one of the purposes of the project is to help users \
  utilize campus resources effectively.

  \item[1.2.8] \textbf{Immersive User Experience}
  The product should provide an immersive user experience to the users with some XR technologies. At least 90% of the users \
  should find the product much more attractive and immersive than other university applications when conducting the user \
  survey. An immersive user experience is one of the unique selling points of our product.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
Currently, students do not have effective ways to connect with peers of same interest and resources available on campus.  One of the most accessible tools for students to utilize campus resources is OSCARplus. However it is for McMaster students and Alumni only,  and does not support interactions between users -- users cannot see if their friends and classmates are joining the events nor send/read comments from others. \\
As for room availability information,  there is no official management system for visitors and students.  Students always occupy empty rooms their found to meet with friends and classmates.  Due to poor management and messy process,  it is usually very difficult to find an appropriate place for team discussion and club events.

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}

This application will not take place of any existing official tools. It intends to improve certain social networking processes students are following and provide a platform for users to connect with each other better. The following are some changes that will impact users.\\
\noindent\\
\textbf{Expand Networking}\\
Students will be able to expand networking when attending events lectures on this social media platform. Users may lose connection with peers when there is a failure in the system. 
\noindent\\
\textbf{Event Registration}\\
Students and alumni will be able to login with their McMaster email and write comments about on campus events, which means there will be a risk of personal identification information (PII) leakage if the data is not stored securely.
\noindent\\
\textbf{Available Room Management}\\
This application can be utilized to get information about lecture time and location which should not be displayed publicly. Therefore insecure data storage may lead to data breaches.

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

The application will be completely stand alone and will not be interfacing with any existing systems.  As described in the previous section, this application should not affect or replace any existing systems.

\subsection{Potential User Problems}

Any potential adverse reactions related to using the device in which application is being launched on (mobile device or tablet) would extend to the use of this application.  Any adverse reactions of Virtual Reality and Augment Reality, like nausea, dizziness and disorientation would be introduced to the use of the application as well.

\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}

\begin{itemize}
\item The database free plan is not able to cope with our projected user growth pattern.
\item Low quality internet connection will lead to latency between user inputs and in-game reactions or even failures of loading in-game assets.
\item The accuracy of input data totally depends on device sensor. Low accuracy data may cause bad user experience.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}

Any failures or downtime on Unity game engine and its third-party libraries may affect the availability of this application. In-game schedules may fail to load when the event and lecture schedule interfaces are down or the two external systems are under maintenance. There will also be a risk of violating privacy laws in the future since the application is collection personal information and there may be new laws prohibit this kind of information collection.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
