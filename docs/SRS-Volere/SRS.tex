\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
\quad The project being outlined in this document is an social media application with location-specific features for \
McMaster University to allow the university's students to connect with each other. The project will allow for interaction \
between users, in addition to allowing users to find information on different parts of the main campus of McMaster \
University, including on-campus events and room availability in buildings.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.2.1] \textbf{Accurate Data Collection}
  The product must collect location and directional data to accurately ascertain the position of the user in the building \
  and campus. This will allow the user to interact with the system and other users of the product to enhance social \
  interactions. The error of data must be less than 5\%.

  \item[1.2.2] \textbf{Ease of Use}
  The product must be user friendly and convenient to use, as many university applications are not used or underused due to \
  the complexity and difficult operation. The end user must be able to easily download and learn the application without \
  external guidance. At least 90\% of users should feel comfortable about the product when conducting the user survey.

  \item[1.2.3] \textbf{Availability}
  The product must be able to support its users unless there is a planned maintenance or external failures. This is important \
  as the product is using real-time data and significant delays or down-times will impact the accuracy and usability of the \
  product.

  \item[1.2.4] \textbf{Reliable Data Communication}
  The product must have good and secure data communication to support the real-time nature of the product. This is important \
  as the product is using real-time data and significant delays will impact the accuracy and usability of the product. The \
  product must be able to provide the desired output within 5 seconds with good university WiFi connection.

  \item[1.2.5] \textbf{Protection of Personal Information}
  The product must keep all personal data provided by users secure in the database. Personal data will be collected securely \
  and only used for product functions. The application must support the removal of user data upon request. This is important \
  because users will complete a consent form that acknowledges their privacy.

  \item[1.2.6] \textbf{User Communication}
  The product must be able to support user-to-user communication. It should provide a friend system for users to add new \
  friends, send messages and emojis to friends and share current location and status (in lecture/event or free) with their \
  friends. This is important because the main purpose of the project is to allow users to connect with peers effectively.

  \item[1.2.7] \textbf{Interactable Campus Buildings}
  The product must be able to provide interactions between users and campus buildings. It must show the availability of the \
  lecture halls and information about ongoing events in a building since one of the purposes of the project is to help users \
  utilize campus resources effectively.

  \item[1.2.8] \textbf{Immersive User Experience}
  The product should provide an immersive user experience to the users with some XR technologies. At least 90\% of the users \
  should find the product much more attractive and immersive than other university applications when conducting the user \
  survey. An immersive user experience is one of the unique selling points of our product.

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Due to McMaster University regulations, we cannot collect information on course schedules.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Software should follow industry standard security protocols
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The app is not expected to function outside the campus of McMaster University.
  \item The backend server host has high availability.
  \item The backend server host has stable performance.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
Currently, students do not have effective ways to connect with peers of same interest and resources available on campus.  One of the most accessible tools for students to utilize campus resources is OSCARplus. However it is for McMaster students and Alumni only,  and does not support interactions between users -- users cannot see if their friends and classmates are joining the events nor send/read comments from others. \\
As for room availability information,  there is no official management system for visitors and students.  Students always occupy empty rooms their found to meet with friends and classmates.  Due to poor management and messy process,  it is usually very difficult to find an appropriate place for team discussion and club events.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system shall allow users to create accounts.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} Users must be associated with accounts to identify themselves and expand their social networking.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users must be able to create an account with a unique username and a password.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to change their password.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} This will allow users to improve the security of their account and recover the account if they forget their password.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users may change password in the settings menu after proving their identity. The user must be notified afterwards.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to add friends.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} One of the main purposes of this application is to make students connect with peers easily. For this to happen, they should be able to make friends on this social media platform.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users can search for other users through username and send a friend request, added friends can be removed from the friend list.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to delete friends.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} When users add users as friends by accident or they no longer connect with each other, they should be able to remove them from the friend list.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users can remove any friends from their friend list.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to send text messages to other users.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} This will make the app more interactive and encourage and enhance socialization between users.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users must be able send messages and to view received messages.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to send audio messages to other users.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} This also improves interactivity and encourages socialization and can be more efficient at times than texting.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users must be able record and send audio messages and and listen to received messages.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to share their location with others.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} For the purpose of expanding social networking, users shall be able to share their current location with friends to meet in person.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users should be able to share their real-time location with friends as long as they agree on the corresponding terms.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to view events on the McMaster University campus.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} Currently there is no way for students of McMaster University to keep up with all the different types of events that are hosted by different clubs and departments. This is one of the main purposes of this application to allow users to discover the time and place for as many events as possible in an intuitive manner\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users will be able to see current / upcoming events at campus buildings that they are looking at / positioned near as well as a cumulative list of nearing events.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to pin events they are interested in.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} It will be much easier for users to find events they are interested in and willing to join again. So that they do not have to browse the event list again and again. While their friends can see what events they are likely to join.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users should be able to pin an event from the event list, this event will be displayed on the user page and accessible to all their friends.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to unpin events.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} In case users are no longer interested in the event or they pinned the event by mistake.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users shall be able to unpin an event they pinned before.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to view lecture schedule information.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} This will allow users to verify their availability for events without needing to leave the app.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users must be able view lecture times and locations. \\
    \item The system shall allow users to pin lectures they are attending.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} Sharing schedules with friends can increase friendship. If two friends are taking the same course, they can join lectures, discuss assignments and prepare for midterms together. So it is important for the system to have the functionality to display lectures a user is taking.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users should be able to pin a lecture from the list as attended lecture, this lecture will be displayed on the user page and accessible to all their friends.\\
    \item The system shall allow users to unpin lectures.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} In case users are no longer taking the lecture or they added the lecture by mistake.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users shall be able to unpin a lecture they pinned before.\\
    \item The system shall have administrator accounts that have special modification access.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} Administrator accounts should be utilized for the purpose of providing accurate and up-to-date event and lecture information.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The system shall be able to mark specific users as administrators and give them access to edit, add and remove all in-app assets.\\
    \item The system shall allow users with an administrator account to add, edit, and remove events.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} The event information must be up to date and accurate. The administrator account will maintain all events so that there is a singular source of information. Additionally, this reduces the chances of errors being introduced to the system.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} A new event can be created only by a user who is logged in as an administrator. The information for those events can be changed only by administrators. Events can be deleted only by administrators.\\
    \item The system shall allow users with an administrator account to add, edit, and remove lectures from the schedule.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} The lecture information must be up to date and accurate as well. Administrators are needed to manage the schedule.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} A lecture on the schedule can be created, deleted, or updated by a user who logged in as an administrator.
    \item Each event shall be associated with a club/department, location and time.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} In order for the application to schedule events for the users to see and interact with, all specific details about the event should be provided to the system\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} When a department/club requests for an event to be posted on the application, they have to provide details about the building and room number it will be held in, along with the date and time the event will take place at.\\
    \item Each lecture shall be associated with an instructor, location and time.\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} In order to find empty rooms and help users who want to attend specific lectures, all details about the lectures should be provided to the system.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} When a lecture is added or modified, all the details mentioned above must be set as mandatory fields.\\

Although the product is designed to work for university, this can be porte to other large events and buildings to help users navigate and coordinate better.

\section{Security Requirements}
\subsection{Access Requirements}

There will be three levels of access. 

The first will be before login and account creation, where anyone can access. They must not have access to anything beyond the login, account creation, and account recovery pages.

The second will be after login that verifies their identity, where the user has provided information matching the McMaster student or faculty member with McMaster email account. Only the user can access this page.

The third level will the the administrator account, used for adding, deleting, or editing official events. This account can be accessed by login that verifies that they are the maintainer, this will be used by the maintainers to check the functionality of the product  and pull logs that are not accessible to users.

\subsection{Integrity Requirements}

The product will prevent introduction of duplicate data, to guarantee that all user identities are unique.

In the future, the database and server can protect itself from excessive use with a load balancer and additional servers being added.

\subsection{Privacy Requirements}

All data collected must be encrypted on transit by industry standard encryption algorithm.

The product will require users to agree on the terms prior to account creation and additional data submission.
The product must erase all data if the user requests, or when account is deleted.
Additionally, accounts that are inactive for a certain period of time will have their account deleted after notice to prevent unnecessary data being held.

\subsection{Audit Requirements}

N/A (This currently does not apply, once the product is ready to be used in multiple universities and regions, audit requirements will be reconsidered.)

\subsection{Immunity Requirements}

The product must only use open source libraries with many users and continuous security updates. 
As open source libraries are used by millions of people, vulnerabilities are found and patched much earlier.

The product must undergo vulnerability checks before a build is pushed to the users.
This will prevent vulnerabilities from inadequate codes from being introduced to user devices.

Security updates must be done as soon as possible when they are announced for used packages.
This will reduce the chances of novel attacks from affecting the product.

\end{itemize}
\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}

This application will not take place of any existing official tools. It intends to improve certain social networking processes students are following and provide a platform for users to connect with each other better. The following are some changes that will impact users.\\
\noindent\\
\textbf{Expand Networking}\\
Students will be able to expand networking when attending events lectures on this social media platform. Users may lose connection with peers when there is a failure in the system. 
\noindent\\
\textbf{Event Registration}\\
Students and alumni will be able to login with their McMaster email and write comments about on campus events, which means there will be a risk of personal identification information (PII) leakage if the data is not stored securely.
\noindent\\
\textbf{Available Room Management}\\
This application can be utilized to get information about lecture time and location which should not be displayed publicly. Therefore insecure data storage may lead to data breaches.

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

The application will be completely stand alone and will not be interfacing with any existing systems.  As described in the previous section, this application should not affect or replace any existing systems.

\subsection{Potential User Problems}

Any potential adverse reactions related to using the device in which application is being launched on (mobile device or tablet) would extend to the use of this application.  Any adverse reactions of Virtual Reality and Augment Reality, like nausea, dizziness and disorientation would be introduced to the use of the application as well.

\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}

\begin{itemize}
\item The database free plan is not able to cope with our projected user growth pattern.
\item Low quality internet connection will lead to latency between user inputs and in-game reactions or even failures of loading in-game assets.
\item The accuracy of input data totally depends on device sensor. Low accuracy data may cause bad user experience.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}

Any failures or downtime on Unity game engine and its third-party libraries may affect the availability of this application. In-game schedules may fail to load when the event and lecture schedule interfaces are down or the two external systems are under maintenance. There will also be a risk of violating privacy laws in the future since the application is collection personal information and there may be new laws prohibit this kind of information collection.

\section{Tasks}

\subsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
The development of the project will be divided into two phases
\begin{itemize}
    \item Revision 0, initial development
    \item Revision 1, refinement of the project and documents
\end{itemize}
Revision 0 starts now and ends with the Verification and Validation Report. In this phase, the team will work on some design-related documents and specify the scope of the project, what skills the team will be using, and how the interaction of different components be. Then the team will start implementation as proof of concept and demonstrate their product to stakeholders. After that, the team will write a V\&V report based on the demonstration and stakeholder feedback.\\
Revision 1 will focus on the refinement of the application and documents. In the previous phase, the team finished a bunch of drafted documents, and in this phase, the team should put all effort into incorporating feedback into these documents and the application itself. There will not be any major new features added in Revision 1.

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}

\qquad There are no requirements to migrate to this product besides recruiting sufficient number of users.
With the the starting users, there may not be enough engagement for this application to be widely used.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}

\qquad Currently, all data we need are in OSCARplus and club management part of the university administration.
These data will be requested via API or a new web based or internal input system will be made to move all the data over to our product.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  
  
\quad The team members will need to collectively acquire some technical and non-technical skills and knowledge in order to succeed in this capstone project. The following is a list of skills that are critical to the project and course deliverables.
  \begin{enumerate}[1]
      \item Presentation skills for demonstrations and capstone EXPO
      \item Documentation skills
      \item Team management skills including time management and work distribution
      \item Skills of Unity game development
      \item Skills of Unity AR development
      \item Integrating external backend systems into a Unity project
      \item Skills of git
      \item Front-end development skills
      \item Back-end development skills including server deployment and database
      \item Organizational skills to lead meetings and discussions on unclear topics in the project
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
  
  
\quad For non-technical skills, team members can develop those skills by practicing and attending courses/workshops. Members can leverage LinkedIn Learning and McMaster workshops to develop management and organizational skills. For documentation and presentation skills, team members can also join related events hosted by the university or refer to past documents and presentations.\\
  There are even more resources available for developing technical skills. Online learning platforms like Udemy will be used for the team to learn new technology-specific domain knowledge and skills. Other online resources like YouTube tutorials and official documentation can help the team master those technical skills as well.\\
  Listed below under each team member's name is a list of skills that the team member will focus on and why they decide to work on them.\\
\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Zihao Du}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Skills: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
      \end{itemize}
      Soft skills are quite important for a team and an engineer. And that's why I'd like to focus on soft skills like presentation skills and documentation skills. It will be not only critical to succeed in this capstone project but also beneficial to software engineering careers. Communication plays a very important role in software engineer's daily work and I will take this opportunity to further improve my skills.\\
      I'll also focus on Unity game development and front-end development because that attracts me the most and what I have the most experience in and I'd like to strengthen my skills and learn more about game development during this project.
      \item \textbf{Firas Elayan}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Skills: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
        \end{itemize}
        Unity and other general platforms for developing products such as the one in our capstone project are a new field to me that I do not have a lot of experience in. I'd like to acquire a near-advanced level of technical skills in relation to those platforms so that I'm able to build an array of good products of a very useful type that function properly and meet all requirements.\\
        Git is an extremely beneficial tool if used correctly. I'd like to improve my skills in git to ensure this project and future projects I participate in building have a smooth development life, especially with how expensive errors and issues can become the more complex the project gets.
      \item \textbf{Matthew Miller}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Skills: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
        \end{itemize}
        I want to work on my presentation skills and documentation skills so that I can focus on improving my oral and written communication skills. Since I have autism, communication has always been a challenge, so I would like to take the opportunity to work on those skills.
        I also chose to focus on Unity game development skills, front-end development skills, and back-end development skills so that I can gain experience with a variety of different coding skills.

      \item \textbf{Waseef Nayeem}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Skills: 2, 4, 5, 6, 10
        \end{itemize}
        I have chosen to focus on a combination of skills that I am experienced in as well ones that are more difficult or new to me. Game development is one of my passions and main hobbies and I always want to learn new techniques to improve my skills. This is why I want to focus on the Unity game and AR development tasks. Since most of my experience is with 2D games, 3D will pose some challenges that I am excited to tackle. I am also interested in learning how to integrate external systems and services into game engines such as Unity as I believe the experience will benefit my future projects. My work on prior projects has taught me the importance of proper documentation. I could improve my documentations skills by practicing technical writing or documentation prior projects. I could also learn new documentation tools and techniques such as using GitHub's wiki features or making a ReadTheDocs page. Lastly, I would like to improve my organization and participation in team settings. To accomplish this I could prepare a personal agenda of items ahead of time or log a to-do list of action items.

\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
