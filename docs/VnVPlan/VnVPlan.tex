This document describes the verification and validation plan for CampusConnection.  Within this document, there will be plans to verify the SRS document, the design plan, the VnV plan, the implementation plan, and the software validation plan.  Furthermore, this document will list specific system tests that cover all functional and non-function requirements we mentioned in the SRS, along with a traceability table between test cases and requirements to bind all requirements with tests. 

This document also includes unit tests, but since the design documentation like MIS is not ready yet, we will only cover the most important modules and their corresponding methods tests. The team will iterate on the VnV plan and have a more detailed version with the test code when the modules are specified in the design document.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}
  
The software we test is a social media application which also uses Augmented Reality features to allow McMaster University students to connect with each other. The software has many different functions to be able to accomplish its goals. These are some of the important functions:

 \begin{itemize}
     \item  Allowing the users to create and manage their account.

     \item  Allowing the users to add, manage and message friends.

     \item  Allowing the users with administrator access to add and manage events and lectures.

     \item  Allowing the users to view and filter lectures and events 
     
     \item Allowing the user to customize their schedule -- bookmark and unbookmark events or lectures based on their interest.

     \item  Identifying major campus buildings through the user's location and camera view, and using the information to display relevant lectures and events.

 \end{itemize}

 

\subsection{Objectives}

\subsubsection{Important Qualities}
In order to develop the software to meet its goals and create a complete product, there are many qualities that are important for our project such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An easily navigable User Interface adaptable to different screen sizes

    \item Sufficient speed and reliability of the building recognition features

    \item Sufficient speed and reliability in sending and receiving messages

    \item Adequate accuracy in tracking the user's location

    \item Appropriate abidance of security requirements regarding critical information such as location and personal data.

    \item Infrastructure to support a passable scale of total concurrent users and total user data storage
    \end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Out of Scope Objectives}
While we would want to satisfy as many positive qualities as possible, due to limited resources , there will be some objectives that we will be leaving out since they are out of scope such as :

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Project longevity requirements:

    This is because the longevity requirements were written with the assumption that the product will be supported even after the duration of the course for years to come which is something that is not possible to verify or guarantee and is out of the scope. Instead, we could have a code inspection with other developers and the supervisor about these requirements to gain some confidence.

    \item  Testing learning requirements:

    We will be producing material to make it easier to understand and use our product but to test every piece of supporting documentation and tutorial content would require long testing sessions with volunteers which can be out of the scope. Instead, we could use the feedback obtained from the survey to improve our learning-specific content.
    
   \item  Advanced extensibility and maintenance requirements:
   
    This is because the project only aims to support senior software students for now and We are not expected to serve all students by the end of Revision 1.  Maintenance requirements are designed for maintainers to maintain the project well in the future (after Revision 1 if the project can be used in real life), not developers. Therefore they will be out of the scope of this documentation. 
    
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Priority of Objectives}
We will be prioritizing reliability in our listed qualities over performance since we want our software to be correct and consistent over fast and unreliable. While we still want to maximize performance where possible, it is difficult to predict exactly how well we will meet our performance criteria since we will be limited by many factors out of our control such as external libraries.

We will also be assuming that any external libraries we depend on (such as Vuforia) will have already been verified by the implementation team due to our lack of control over them. 


\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

Many of the other documents associated with our project are relevant to the Verification and Validation plan such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Development Plan:

	The Development Plan contains the roles and responsibilities of each member, which outlines the tester of each components. It also includes the tools and technologies that will be used to facilitate testing

	\href{https://github.com/beatlepie/4G06CapstoneProjectTeam2/blob/docs-VnV-plan/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan}
    \item Software Requirement Specification (SRS):
          
          The SRS has a lot of components relevant to the VnV plan. The functional requirements are important in identifying the primary functions of the the project while the non functional requirements are critical in identifying the main qualities and objectives of the product. It also contains constraint and assumption information which can help identify out-of-scope objectives.

          \href{https://github.com/beatlepie/4G06CapstoneProjectTeam2/blob/docs-VnV-plan/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{Software Requirement Specification (SRS)}
    \item Hazard Analysis (HA):
    
        The HA document contains the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) which is incredibly useful in understanding the possible failures and their consequences. This can help us assign priorities to different failures that can be translated into priorities for different qualities identified earlier in the document. It also contains more detailed safety and security requirements that we can use to verify our project.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

We will be following a few approaches to verify our SRS document, establishing a strong base for the development of our project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ad-hoc review by classmates:

      We will be conducting unstructured reviews of our SRS document with our classmates. A couple of different teams of students will go through the document to give us feedback and improvement suggestions around its contents and formatting by creating GitHub issues. This has been done before for Revision 0 and we decided to continue verifying the document for Revision 1.
  
  \item Ad-hoc review by our supervisor:

      Our supervisor, Dr. Yuan will perform a review of our SRS document by reading through it and giving us feedback on it. Dr. Yuan's expertise would provide us with valuable insight, allowing us to improve the quality and correctness of the SRS. Given her experience as well, it would ensure we're properly following set standards.

    \item SRS walkthrough by team:

      A walkthrough of the document will be performed together by the members of our team. We will all go through each section and analyse it, where we'll be able to suggest changes and improvements. Different team members worked on different parts of the document, so this walkthrough will allow for new perspectives on each section.
      
   \item Ad-hoc review by TA:
   
   We will perform a review of our SRS with our TA, Sam. This meeting will be used to discuss how we can resolve Revision 0 feedback and we can also get some more suggestions about what can be improved in Revision 1.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Creating mock-ups and prototypes:

      In order to carry out good and efficient evaluations of our design, we will create design mock-ups and prototypes. These will be lo-fi at first and increase in fidelity as the software development progresses. The prototypes will help improve the reviews and feedback of the design by providing a visual (possibly physical) representation of our design, helping reviewers judge the features and quality of the design.
  
  \item Requirements checklist:

      A checklist of our requirements from the SRS document will be made to be used as part of the verification of our design. The checklist will be used during team reviews in order to ensure our design meets the project requirements.
  
  \item Supervisor review:

      As with the SRS document, our designs will receive an ad hoc review by our supervisor, Dr. Yuan. She will ensure our designs meet software standards and adhere to relevant principles.   

  \item Classmates review:

      We will conduct reviews with our classmates to get their input on our designs. This is very valuable for us as our classmates fall under one of our stakeholders, the customers.
      
  \item TA review:

      We will conduct reviews with our TA Same to get his ideas about our designs. He can also help us resolve feedback he gave for Revision 0.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Team review:

      Our team members will review the VnV plan together to ensure the plan is complete and correct in how/what it verifies and validates. The review will allow us to make sure the VnV plan is line with the goals set for our project.
  
  \item Supervisor review:

      As with the SRS document and our designs, our supervisor, Dr. Yuan, will conduct a review of our VnV plan. Her experience and knowledge of software engineering will allow her to find any shortcomings in our plans and to provide very valuable feedback.

  \item Classmates review:

      Our classmates will conduct their own review of our VnV plan. As they resemble our stakeholders and each have their own experience and skills, their feedback can prove to be very beneficial and can provide a range of perspectives on the effectiveness our plan.
      
  \item TA feedback:

      Our TA, Sam will give us feedback on VnV plan.  This feedback will be useful to improve our documentation in Revision 1.

  \item Mutation testing:

      In order to determine how effective our outlined tests in the VnV plan are at ensuring the correctness of our product, we will employ mutation testing. Mutations will be introduced to the parts of our source code that is covered by the test cases outlined here. These mutations would be very small but should cause the tests to fail. This would allow us to determine how effective our tests are at finding faults and flaws in our product's code.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

      Our implementation verification plan involves making use of the system and unit tests we've outlined in the VnV plan to ensure the correctness and quality of the implementation of our product.\\\\
      We've outlined system tests and unit tests for our requirements. The system tests apply to the application as a whole, placing a focus on verifying the correctness of the application and how well it satisfies the requirements we've outlined in our SRS document. Our unit tests focus on specific modules within our application, aiming at assessing the robustness and accuracy of each module when working individually. All our tests are based on our functional and non-functional requirements to ensure our application adheres to our goals for the project.\\\\
      In addition to the tests outlined in this document, we will also employ some static techniques to verify our implementation. We will be making use of verification tools that are able to identify errors and issues in our source code. We will also be conducting code reviews, where we'll be examining our code (without executing it) to find any problems in relation with our code's adherence to our design and requirements.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

      We intend to make use of several different tools that will help us in the testing and verification of our product. We have outlined some of these tools in our development plan.\\\\
      Since we are coding our product using C\#, we will be making use of dotnet format for C\# to format our code. Linters are incredibly useful tools that we can use to detect any programming errors and bugs in our source code, as well as any issues with the style. Using this linter would help avoid these problems growing as we build the project, ensuring its correctness.\\\\
      As we are using Unity as our engine to develop our application, our testing framework will be the Unity Test Framework. Unity Test Framework can be used in both Play Mode and Edit mode and there are other UI driven end to end automated tool that we can use if it is manual testing spends too much time.\\\\
      For all tests or linter mentioned above, we will build a continuous integration pipeline in our Github repo so that they can be tested automatically. 

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

      We will be conductions formal reviews with some of our stakeholders as well as our supervisor, Dr. Yuan. These reviews will ensure that our application meets the requirements as well as the goals of our stakeholders. Dr. Yuan will make sure the product we've build meets different standards.\\\\
      Moreover, we'll use task-based inspection, involving testing different aspects of our app through real-world scenarios. This will aid us in evaluating the functionality of our software. In addition, we will also have students - who represent our stakeholders - test out features of our software, which will allow us to observe our software's performance in the real world. The feedback we get from user testing would be very helpful in ensuring the alignment of our software with the user goals and requirements.    

\section{System Test Description}
\label{sec:system}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

The following section includes system tests for functional requirements defined in the \href{https://github.com/beatlepie/4G06CapstoneProjectTeam2/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} document. In order to cover all the functional requirements, these subsections match exactly the subsections in the SRS document, which cover all the different components of this application. These tests will ensure all requirements are fulfilled and the application works as we expected. Most of the following tests will be run manually while some of them will be automated.

\subsubsection{Pre-Registration Settings}

This section includes all test cases related to what users can do before they start to use the application. This will include the requirement for the consent form and user privacy protection (FR-1-1). In order to create an account and use the application, the user must agree to the terms and conditions in the consent form. The following tests will have random accounts as input and we assume the success of the test on random accounts indicates the success of the test on all accounts.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{FRT-PR1}}

\section{Unit Test Description}
\label{sec:unit}

This section includes all unit tests for functional and non-functional requirements. Though most of the requirements will be tested manually, unit testing will still be utilized for some basic functionalities of some low level components. According to the module hierarchy in \href{https://github.com/beatlepie/4G06CapstoneProjectTeam2/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftArchitecture/MG.pdf}{MG}, the following modules will be tested with unit tests:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{M1} User

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

All modules defined above are within the testing scope.  The scope of unit testing was limited to the components that could be automatically tested. Third-party library modules like Vuforia and Mapbox are out of the scope of unit testing and we will trust they are bug-free. Also, high-level modules in the hierarchy are usually responsible for rendering UI and reacting to user actions (e.g. user profile module, lecture list module) therefore they are out of the scope of unit testing as well (in fact they are not quite testable with Unity test framework). Instead, they are tested with manual testing.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

The following sections details unit tests for functional requirements. It is an essential aspect of testing as it verifies whether the modules are behaving
correctly given the requirements in the SRS.

\subsubsection{User Module}

This section will contain all unit tests for the module ``User''. The tests are chosen based on common user flows and cover the most important methods of this module. The getter and setter methods are part of the unit test as well, but they will not be included in the section because they are trivial.

\subsection{Usability Survey}
\label{sec:survey}
Usability testing holds particular significance, especially for a social networking application such as this one. We intend to conduct a usability survey among a select group of students to gather feedback. Initially, we will start with a sample size of 5 to 10 participants. If we consistently receive repetitive suggestions, signalling that we've addressed the majority of issues, we will maintain this sample size. However, if new issues arise or further insights are needed, we will consider conducting another survey with a larger sample size in the future.\\
The survey will be composed of following three session and take about 30 minutes to complete:
\subsubsection{Tasks}
\textbf{The participant will be completing the following tasks. They will use the project as a guest or user or administrator. Each role will have unique tasks and the role is assigned randomly at the start of a test. A task fails if the tester asks for help or spends more than 1 minute to complete a single subtask. This section is to test if the UI and layout is user-friendly and easy-to-understand.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lecture
\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct from menu page to lecture page
\item Search for a lecture the tester asked for
\item Check the location of the lecture
\item Bookmark and then unbookmark the lecture
\end{enumerate}
\item Event
\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct from map page to event page
\item Search for an event the tester asked for
\item Check the location of the event
\item Bookmark and then unbookmark the event
\end{enumerate}
\item Activity Management
\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct from menu page to event/lecture page (tester decide which page they will test)
\item Add a new activity, where the tester will provide details
\end{enumerate}
\item Map
\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct from menu page to map page
\item Zoom in and center the map to show the current location
\end{enumerate}
\item AR Camera
\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct from menu page to AR page
\item Walk around and check if there exist AR object or watch the recording if the participant is not in a target building
\end{enumerate}
\item User Profile
\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct from map page to user profile page
\item Check the program and level of the user
\item Edit any part of the profiles
\item Check the lectures and events that are bookmarked
\end{enumerate}
\item Friend and Chat
\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct from menu page to friend page
\item \textit{option 1:} Send a request to tester's account
\item \textit{option 2:} Accept a request from tester
\item Open a chat with tester and send a message
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Reminder: A participant will not do all of the tasks. They will be given a random role at the start of the test and the tasks they will have depend on the role. Administrator will perform task 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; User will perform task 1, 4, 5, 6, 7; Guest will perform task 2, 4, 6.}
\subsubsection{Rating}
\textbf{This section covers tests for some non-functional requirements. The participant will answer the following agree/disagree questions on a rating scale of 5. Here is a breakdown:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1: Strongly Disagree
\item 2: Disagree
\item 3: Neutral
\item 4: Agree
\item 5: Strongly Agree
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Immediate Visual Response when Clicking:}  The application provides visual feedback when using different features or switching between pages.
	\item \textbf{Appealing Colour Scheme:} The colour scheme chosen for the interface is similar to McMaster official application.
	\item \textbf{No Technical or Software-specific Language:} The product does not use technical/software-specific language unless necessary.
	\item \textbf{Common periods of usage:} You will be using the application mostly during school time (from 8:30 AM to 6:30 PM).
	\item \textbf{Cultural Friendliness:} The application does not have any words or symbols that are offensive to you.\\\\
	\item \textbf{Customer Satisfaction:} This application will be useful for my daily life and I'd like to recommend it to my friends.
	\item \textbf{Loading Speed:} This application loads/updates what I need in a reasonable time.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Open-ended Questions}
\textbf{In this section we invite participants to provide their thoughts on the pros and cons of the project. They should feel free to share any feedback or insights.}
\begin{itemize}
\item What do you think is the most difficult to use feature and why?
\item Which feature will you use the most in your daily live and why?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Static Testing Knowledge - Matthew Miller
	
	One skill that the team will need to complete the verification and validation\
	of the project is static testing knowledge. One way to master this skill is by\
	practicing through code reviews, which involve reading through the code to check\
	for errors. This can be done with our own code or another group's code. Another\
	approach to acquiring this knowledge is by watching tutorials on how to do static\
	testing to help further understanding of the procedure.

	I plan to acquire knowledge of static testing to gain a better understanding of\
	the procedure, as well as putting that knowledge into practice. I chose these\
	approaches because I find that I learn best by applying knowledge in real-world\
	settings.
	
	\item Stress Testing, Apache JMeter - Zihao Du
	
	One of the skill the team needs to acquire for testing purpose is stress testing since the application has a max capacity of users and the team need to check if the server is robust enough to fulfil the requirement. One approach to master this skill is to read their official user manual and tutorial -- as an Apache project, it has a detailed tutorial on the website for beginners. Another approach to acquire the knowledge is to watch some crach course videos about how to use JMeter for stress test like \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXGcBvWYl-U}{this}. 
	
	I decide to learn this skill by reading the user manual on their website. It is not because JMeter has a detailed tutorial with step by step screenshot which is very easy to understand, but the official documents can give me a better understanding of the tool itself in general since we need it for both server and database load testing.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Automated and Manual Dynamic Testing Knowledge - Michael Kim
  
  For automated dynamic testing knowledge, learning about tools that show code coverage\
  will allow me to identify any aspects of the product that require further testing.\
  I am interested in this as I had many instances where issues previously caught\
  reoccured after a different fix because I had not automated the test cases and\
  neglected them. This will help me set up automated tests anyone can run before\
  pushing to GitHub to check that their code did not break a previously functional\
  segment of the product. Another method of aquiring this skill would code review\
  and documentation to understand what purpose each of the functions serve.\
  This will help me write comprehensive tests and cover all known use cases of the\
  code. I am interested in this method as the product may have other maintainers\
  join in the future, and having these documentations and comments will help in their\
  understanding of the product and continuing the proper maintenance.

  Another aspect of automated dynamic testing that I must learn is how to set up the automated tests and run them all
  For manual dynamic testing knowledge, I will learn about proper usage of Burp Suite,\
  Android Studio Logging tools, Valgrind, and other monitoring and logging applications\
  to help verify the activities of our product. I chose to learn more about this because\
  my experiences in Co-Op as Security Specialist Intern piqued by interest in software testing\
  and verification of security requirements. Through this experience, I have tested applications\
  to see whether they adhere to security requirements imposed by the non-functional requirements.\
  There are various tutorials that can be found on YouTube and extensive documentation provided by\
  the community that uses these tools. This will help significantly in understanding the specific uses\
  of these tools and allow me to test rapidly when a new prototype or update is built. Another approach\
  in learning this technique would be going through bug reports and reproduction steps outlined for other\
  applications. From my Co-Op experience, I had to go through some of these reports so that our products\
  would not experience the same failures other companies have. I am interested in learning more about this\
  process and see what other issues were found and how they were fixed. This will help in grasping the proper\
  procedure of manual dynamic testing and potential failures. There are detailed reports and research on existing\
  products that has experienced significant failures, such as the 2022 Rogers Communications outage. This will also\
  help in prioritization of issues so that critical fixes and failures are patched first.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Testing Tools: Unity Test Framework - Waseef Nayeem
	
	One of the specific technologies that will be used for verification and validation is the Unity Test Framework.\
	Unity provides a fully-featured solution for unit testing and also provides tools for automating more complex tests.\
	There is extensive documentation on the UTF on Unity's website as well as several videos and examples that can be used to learn.\
	Another way to learn and master is through experimentation. I could create some basic test assemblies and unit test and modify the inputs or scale up to more complex testable cases.

	Since my role in the project is focused on Unity development I will research and learn how to use the Unity Test Framework.\
	I will accomplish this by quickly learning the basics of UTF and then experimenting early with test cases. I indicated in my previous reflection that\
	software testing is an area I would like to improve in. This will allow me to develop better testing methodologies and improve the quality of future software projects.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Object detection domain knowledge - Abhiram Neelamraju \\
	
	Knowledge in the field of object detection is something that could be of great use to the developers. It is something that could help the rest of the team along with developers figure out what is within and what is beyond the scope of the project.
	We can use this information to better plan our features and come up with a realistic expectation for our product. For example, we can research into Vuforia and what its good at and what it might have problems with. \\

	There are many ways to obtain this domain knowledge regarding object detection. There are several free courses available on websites such as coursera, udemy etc. covering relevant content. There are also youtube tutorials that cover similar content especially specific to Vuforia. 
	My personal choice of learning method would be youtube. There are many youtube videos covering basic principles of object detection along with end-to-end project examples implementing Vuforia. This is a great efficient tool to learn from for free.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Knowledge of AR Standards - Firas Elayan \\

  It is essential that the team acquires knowledge of existing AR standards, as it will be needed to effectively verify and validate our application. These standards tell us about the quality that our product must have. They can also act as guidelines for creating a user interface that works well and is appealing to users. Knowledge of these standards and applying them to the verification and validation of our software will ensure it follows the best practices and performs at its highest level.
  
  One way to learn this knowledge is to watch tutorial videos. Our supervisor has recommended some videos for beginners, and another way to acquire this domain knowledge is to read documentations of third party library, for example user manual of Unity 3D. I want to learn these standards by watching videos, these crash course videos can help me know the standards quickly and apply what I learned to ensure the quality of the application is the best it could be.\\\\
