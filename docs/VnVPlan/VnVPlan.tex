\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}
  
The software being tested is a social media application which also uses Augmented Reality features to allow McMaster University students to connect with each other. The software has many different functions to be able to accomplish its goals. These are some of the important functions:

 \begin{itemize}
     \item  Allowing the users to create and manage their account.

     \item  Allowing the users to add, manage and message friends.

     \item  Allowing the users with administrator access to add and manage events.

     \item  Allowing the users to view ongoing events and pin and unpin them based on interest.

     \item  Identifying major campus buildings through the user's location and camera view, and using the information to display relevant lectures, events and their timings.

 \end{itemize}

 

\subsection{Objectives}

In order to develop the software to meet its goals and create a complete product, there are many qualities that are important for our project such as:

\begin{itemize}

    \item  Correctness of the software in achieving its designated functions

    \item An easily navigable User Interface adaptable to different screen sizes

    \item Sufficient speed and reliability of the building recognition features

    \item Sufficient speed and reliability in sending and receiving messages

    \item Adequate accuracy in tracking the user's location

    \item Appropriate abidance of security requirements regarding critical information such as location and personal data.

    \item Infrastructure to support a passable scale of total concurrent users and total user data storage

    \end{itemize}



While we would want to satisfy as many positive qualities as possible, due to limited resources , there will be some objectives that we will be leaving out since they are out of scope such as :

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Project longevity requirements:

    This is because the longevity requirements were written with the assumption that the product will be supported even after the duration of the course for years to come which is something that is not possible to verify or guarantee and is out of the scope.

    \item  Testing learning requirements:

    We will be producing material to make it easier to understand and use our product but to test every piece of supporting documentation and tutorial content would require long testing sessions with volunteers which can be out of the scope. Instead, since we will be testing our user interface, we could use the feedback obtained there to improve our learning specific content as well.
    
\end{itemize}



We will be prioritizing reliability in our listed qualities over performance since we want our software to be correct and consistent over fast and unreliable. While we still want to maximize performance where possible, it is difficult to predict exactly how well we will meet our performance criteria since we will be limited by many factors out of our control such as external libraries.

We will also be assuming that any external libraries we depend on (such as Vuforia) will have already been verified by the implementation team due to our lack of control over them. 


\subsection{Relevant Documentation}





Many of the other documents associated with our project are relevant to the Verification and Validation plan such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Software Requirement Specification (SRS):
          
          The SRS has a lot of components relevant to the VnV plan. The functional requirements are important in identifying the primary functions of the the project while the non functional requirements are critical in identifying the main qualities and objectives of the product. It also contains constraint and assumption information which can help identify out-of-scope objectives.

          \citet{SRS}
    \item Hazard Analysis (HA):
    
        The HA document contains the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) which is incredibly useful in understanding the possible failures and their consequences. This can help us assign priorities to different failures that can be translated into priorities for different qualities identified earlier in the document. It also contains more detailed safety and security requirements that we can use to verify our project.

        \citet{HA}
\end{itemize}


\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
  ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for 
  something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

This section includes all unit tests for functional and non-functional requirements. Though most of the requirements will be tested manually, unit testing will still be utilized for some basic functionalities of all components. Since the team has not completed a detailed design document, this section cannot refer to all modules in \href{https://github.com/beatlepie/4G06CapstoneProjectTeam2/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftDetailedDes/MIS.pdf}{MIS}. Instead it will refer to a list of core modules to be implemented:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{M1} User
	\item \textbf{M2} Friend
	\item \textbf{M3} Building
	\item \textbf{M4} Event
	\item \textbf{M5} Lecture
\end{itemize}
It is the first draft of the implementation design, and a more detailed version of unit test will be added once the MIS is completed.

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

All modules defined above are within the testing scope.  The scope of unit testing was limited to the components that could be automatically tested. The AR module is out of the scope since it is largely composed of a third-parity library, Vuforia. It is a sophisticated AR software development kit, so we assumed that Vuforia’s logic is correct and therefore shall not be tested.
