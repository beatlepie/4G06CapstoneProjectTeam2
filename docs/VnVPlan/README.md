This document outlines the verification and validation of CampusConnections. Within this document, there will be plans for verifying the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, the design plan, the VnV plan, the implementation plan, and the software plan. This document will also list the methods of testing that we plan to use. Furthermore, this document will list specific system and unit tests as described in our Functional and Nonfunctional requirements in the [Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](../SRS/SRS.pdf), and the modules in the [Module Guide (MG)](../Design/SoftArchitecture/MG.pdf) and [Module Interface Specification (MIS)](../Design/SoftDetailedDes/MIS.pdf).
