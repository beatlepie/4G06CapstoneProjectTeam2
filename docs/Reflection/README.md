# Reflection

Document: [Reflection](Reflection.pdf)

Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a learning experience. Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this document will be used to help the Teaching Assistants grade how well the team responded to feedback. In addition, several CEAB (Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board) Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based on the team's reflections.
