# Automated tests

The folder contains the automated tests for Campus Connections.

Unit tests are located under CampusConnectionsTest/Assets/Editor/*.cs files.

This test project copies over the code from Campus Connections source code and runs the automated test separately due to GitHub Actions being unable to properly import large local packages.
